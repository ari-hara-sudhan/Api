# Api
Exploring for business operations &amp; usecases



API - APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE:


simple terms: It's is used as a interface for many application like web application -restfulapi, graphql,serveless , 

And it's is used in domain of 

-> Cloud computing 

-> serveless

-> restfulservice

-> iot devices

& many more 

many software solutions come with the developers page , like api we can access their services , by api example messaging services , calling services

an application that gains popularity, other developers and companies may also want to interface with it and leverage the technology or data. This can create a great opportunity to exponentially expand the influence of your company/organization.


TYPES OF API:


1.Web APIs (HTTP/HTTPS):These are APIs that are accessed via standard web protocols like HTTP or HTTPS. They are typically used to enable communication between different software systems over the internet.

2.RESTful APIs:Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs adhere to the REST architectural style. They use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. They often return data in JSON or XML format.

3.SOAP APIs:Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) APIs use XML as their message format and typically rely on HTTP or SMTP as the transport protocol. SOAP APIs are known for their strict standards and support for advanced features like security and transaction handling.

4.GraphQL APIs:GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries. Unlike REST APIs, which expose a fixed set of endpoints, GraphQL APIs allow clients to request only the data they need, enabling more efficient data fetching and reducing over-fetching.

5.WebSocket APIs: WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. WebSocket APIs enable real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers, making them suitable for applications like chat apps, online gaming, and financial trading platforms.

6.Library APIs:Library APIs provide a set of functions and procedures for developers to use in their own applications. These APIs are often packaged as software libraries or SDKs (Software Development Kits) and are designed to simplify complex tasks or provide access to specific features.

7.Operating System APIs:Operating system APIs provide interfaces for developers to interact with the underlying operating system. They allow applications to perform tasks such as file I/O, networking, process management, and accessing hardware devices.

8.Hardware APIs: Hardware APIs provide access to hardware components such as sensors, cameras, and peripherals. They enable developers to build applications that interact with hardware devices, such as mobile apps that use a device's GPS sensor or IoT devices that collect data from various sensors.

9.Cloud APIs: Cloud APIs provide access to cloud services and resources, allowing developers to manage and interact with cloud infrastructure programmatically. Examples include APIs provided by cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

10.Third-party APIs:Third-party APIs are provided by external organizations or developers and allow access to their services or data. These APIs enable developers to integrate third-party functionality into their own applications, such as social media APIs for sharing content or payment APIs for processing transactions.

Serverless, Microservices & Other Trends in API and Services Architecture


APIs are the building blocks of modern applications. There are many trends in architecture and implementation for new API driven applications. Just a few years ago, many applications were created as a giant monolith. Today, microservices is the rave, but serverless computing and no-ops are just around the corner from major adoption. Event based backend programming such as serverless computing also fits in with other trends like blockchain.

API DESIGN :

APIs are an integral part of system design. In system design, architects define how various components of a system interact with each other to achieve specific functionalities and objectives. APIs serve as the contracts or interfaces through which these components communicate.

When designing a system, architects often design APIs to:

1. Define Interactions:APIs specify how different parts of the system can communicate with each other. This includes the methods or functions available for use, the data formats they accept and return, and any authentication or authorization mechanisms required.

2. Promote Modularity:APIs facilitate the creation of modular systems by allowing components to interact through well-defined interfaces. This modularity enhances flexibility, scalability, and maintainability, as components can be developed, tested, and updated independently.

3. Enable Integration: APIs enable the integration of diverse technologies, services, and applications into a cohesive system. By providing standardized interfaces, APIs allow third-party developers, partners, and systems to interact with a system's functionality, data, or services.

4. Encapsulate Complexity:APIs encapsulate the complexity of underlying systems or services, providing simplified and standardized interfaces for interacting with them. This abstraction shields users from implementation details and allows for easier consumption and usage.

5. Facilitate Reusability:APIs promote code reuse by exposing functionalities in a reusable manner. Developers can leverage existing APIs to quickly build new applications or services without reinventing the wheel, thereby improving development efficiency and reducing time-to-market.

6. Support Scalability:APIs support system scalability by enabling distributed architectures and parallel processing. By providing interfaces for communication between distributed components, APIs facilitate horizontal scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
